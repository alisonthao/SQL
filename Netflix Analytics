--I am using Postgre SQL to query a database of Netflix data to answer questions about the data--


#1 How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)
  select count(*) 
  from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
  where type = 'Movie';

  select max(date(date_added)) 
  from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";


#3 List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order
  select title 
  from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
  order by title asc;


#4 Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?
  select director 
  from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" np 
  join "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" nti
  on np.show_id=nti.show_id
  where title = 'Bright Star';


#5 What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
  select title, release_year
